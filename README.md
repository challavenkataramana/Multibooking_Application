 The project was developed using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend.

The application features a secure authentication system integrating Google Login and JWT authentication, ensuring safe access for users. The frontend is designed with a dynamic and responsive UI, allowing users to browse and book hotels effortlessly.

For data management, Google Sheets was used as a backend to efficiently store and handle hotel information. Additionally, a dynamic carousel feature was implemented to enhance user engagement by providing an interactive way to explore available hotels.
